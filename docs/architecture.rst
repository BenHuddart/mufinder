Architecture
============

MuFinder is organized around a small set of package layers. The layers are
designed to keep scientific calculations, project state, execution services,
and PySide widgets understandable to both humans and coding agents.

Package layers
--------------

``mufinder.domain``
   Dataclasses, enums, timestamps, and durable domain records. This layer must
   not import outer MuFinder packages.

``mufinder.castep_io``
   CASTEP parsing, writing, schema metadata, presets, and validation. It owns
   CASTEP syntax details and should not depend on UI, services, workflow
   orchestration, or scientific algorithms.

``mufinder.persistence``
   JSON storage and codec helpers. Persistence may serialize domain objects but
   must not reach into UI, services, workflow expansion, or science modules.

``mufinder.science``
   Numerical and crystallographic algorithms, including site generation,
   structural comparison, UEP analysis, magnetic structures, magnetic fields,
   and demagnetizing tensors. Science code may use domain records and CASTEP
   parsing helpers where those are part of scientific inputs, but it must remain
   UI-free and service-free.

``mufinder.workflow``
   Pure workflow expansion and rendering contracts. This layer turns resolved
   workflow state into ``JobSpec`` objects and rendered input files without
   owning project mutation, runner state, or widgets. Each workflow is exposed
   as a keyword-only ``expand_*`` function returning ``list[JobSpec]`` that
   layers ``InputTemplate`` parameters in ``MERGE_PRECEDENCE_ORDER``; see
   ``mufinder.workflow.base`` for the contract. ``ConvergenceWorkflow`` and
   ``MuonSiteWorkflow`` remain as deprecated class wrappers over their
   ``expand_*`` functions (see :doc:`compatibility_policy`).

``mufinder.services``
   Project-level state management, local and remote execution, journals,
   scheduling, and service orchestration. Services own lifecycle transitions and
   persistence-facing workflows, but they must not import PySide widgets.

``mufinder.app``
   PySide widgets, dialogs, theme helpers, and main-window wiring. UI code may
   depend on lower layers but should delegate reusable planning, execution, and
   calculation logic back to services, workflow, or science modules.

Dependency directions
---------------------

The intended direction is inward from UI to services/workflow/science and then
to domain/data helpers. Lower layers must not import higher layers.

Allowed examples:

- ``mufinder.app`` calling ``mufinder.services`` or ``mufinder.science``
- ``mufinder.services`` mutating project state and invoking science helpers
- ``mufinder.workflow`` consuming ``mufinder.domain`` and ``mufinder.castep_io``
- ``mufinder.science`` consuming ``mufinder.domain`` records

Disallowed examples:

- ``mufinder.science`` importing ``mufinder.app`` widgets
- ``mufinder.workflow`` importing ``mufinder.services`` runners
- ``mufinder.services`` importing ``mufinder.app`` dialogs
- ``mufinder.domain`` importing any outer MuFinder package

These boundaries are enforced by ``tests/test_agent_harness.py``. If a future
feature genuinely requires a new dependency direction, update this document and
the structural test in the same change.

Refactoring policy
------------------

When duplicated UI code starts to encode workflow, execution, or styling
policy, move the reusable part into the appropriate shared layer:

- workflow-row planning belongs in ``mufinder.app.workflow_submission`` or a
  lower non-UI service if it no longer depends on widgets
- job lifecycle transitions belong in ``mufinder.services``
- scientific calculation behavior belongs in ``mufinder.science``
- reusable PySide styling belongs in ``mufinder.app.theme``
- persisted compatibility behavior belongs in ``mufinder.persistence`` or the
  owning service, with a ledger entry in :doc:`compatibility_policy`

The preferred outcome is code that future agents can navigate by package name,
not by remembering where a previous implementation happened to grow.

Workflow parameter surface policy
---------------------------------

Workflow configuration dialogs should present shared CASTEP parameters first,
in a stable cross-workflow order, before any workflow-specific controls.

The shared prefix lives in ``mufinder.app.workflow_parameters`` and currently
orders the common rows as:

- ``basis_precision``
- ``cut_off_energy``
- ``elec_energy_tol``
- ``kpoint_mp_grid``

Workflow-specific rows should follow after that common prefix. Advanced or
rarely adjusted controls such as ``fine_cut_off_energy`` should remain advanced
unless a workflow has a strong reason to expose them by default.

When adding a new workflow parameter surface, use the shared helper in
``mufinder.app.workflow_parameters`` instead of encoding another local ordering
rule in an individual widget.
